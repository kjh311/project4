Technologies Used:
- Angular
- BreweryDB API
- Express
- Node

Approach:
I wanted to see if I could create a Single Page App while consuming an API.
I chose Angular for the SPA, NgRoute to help with API. I used widgets from
Facebook, Twitter, and rating-widget.com to help with the reviews.

Installing:
After forking the repo, run 'NPM INSTALL' to install dependencies.
'Nodemon server.js' in terminal, then 'localhost:3000'
