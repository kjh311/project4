CRAFT BEER-ZILLA is an app that uses the BreweryDB API to list
craft breweries, along with the beers they sell, with descriptions,
user comments, and ratings.  It will also show any related images.

Technologies Used:
- Angular
- BreweryDB API
- Express
- Node

Approach:
I wanted to see if I could create a Single Page App while consuming an API.
I chose Angular for the SPA, NgRoute to help with API. I used widgets from
Facebook, Twitter, and rating-widget.com to help with the reviews.

Installing:
After forking the repo, run 'NPM INSTALL' to install dependencies.
'Nodemon server.js' in terminal, then 'localhost:3000'
