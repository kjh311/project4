CRAFT BEER-ZILLA is an app that uses the BreweryDB API to list
craft breweries, along with the beers they sell, with descriptions,
user comments, and ratings.  It will also show any related images.

Approach:

I wanted to see if I could create a Single Page App while consuming an API.
I chose Angular for the SPA, NgRoute to help with API. I used widgets from
Facebook, Twitter, and rating-widget.com to help with the reviews.

Installing:
After forking the repo, run 'NPM INSTALL' to install dependencies.
'Nodemon server.js' in terminal, then 'localhost:3000'.

ICEBOX FEATURES:
- I would like to add the ability to locate breweries close to my location,
but I need to get the premium API key.
- Would like to add a loading screen while the data is being returned from the API.
